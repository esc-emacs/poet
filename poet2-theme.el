;;; poet-dark-theme.el -- A theme for prose.

;; Version: 2.0

;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs has very good support for multiple fonts in a single
;; file.  Poet uses this support to make it much more convenient to
;; write prose within Emacs, with particular attention paid to
;; org-mode and markdown-mode.  Code blocks, tables, etc are
;; formatted in monospace text with the appropriate backgrounds.

;; Recommended customizations for using this theme
;;
;; - Set up the base fonts you'd like to use in Emacs before loading Poet
;;     (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Iosevka" :height 130)
;;     (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "Iosevka")
;;     (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "Baskerville")
;;   On loading this theme captures the default and treats that for fixed-pitch
;;   rendering.
;;
;; - Enable variable pitch mode for editing text
;; (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
;;            (lambda ()
;;             (variable-pitch-mode 1))
;;
;; - Some other modes I like to enable/disable
;;     (olivetti-mode 1)        ;; Centers text in the buffer
;;     (flyspell-mode 1)        ;; Catch Spelling mistakes
;;     (typo-mode 1)            ;; Good for symbols like em-dash
;;     (blink-cursor-mode 0)    ;; Reduce visual noise
;;     (linum-mode 0)           ;; No line numbers for prose
;;
;; - And prettier org mode bullets:
;;     (setq org-bullets-bullet-list
;;         '("◉" "○"))
;;     (org-bullets 1)
